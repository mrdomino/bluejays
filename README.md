# bluejays
What if everything was bluejay song.

## Bird song sources

* [This one](http://macaulaylibrary.org/search?media_collection=1&taxon_id=11999751&taxon_rank_id=67&q=Blue+Jay) (a famous one) has a ton of audio recordings.
* Haven't even tried to download it, but [this](http://limetorrentlinkmix.com/Bird-Songs-of-the-Americas-(35-Volumes)-torrent-748721.html) could be a good starting kit.
* Probably we could extract recordings from [here](http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Cyanocitta-cristata) too with some effort.
